I have built a new computer today.

Its my first time building in a rack case (4U) and I had some challenges fitting
the (too) large fans I bought for the build.

I had to repurpose the "speaker-bar". I did this by drilling a few holes in
the case as well as in the "speaker-bar".

After a nice refresher of which drill bit is for what material.
(from left to right) Concrete, wood, metal! :)

All in all I am happy about the build and the parts and I am looking forward
to being able to run two(!) instances of 'simple' build tool ;) after
fastening down the wiring.
